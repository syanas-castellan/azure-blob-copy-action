  http_headers:
    description: |
      YAML document that allows setting http headers on blobs when uploading to Azure.

      The supported headers are: Cache-Control, Content-Type, Content-Encoding, Content-Language, Content-Disposition (case sensitive).

      The yaml document must resolve to an array where each element has a <glob> and <headers> values.

      If a file is matched at multiple times, the first match wins.

      By default, the Content-Type is discovered using mime-db mostly using UTF-8 charset.

      For example:

      http_headers: |
        - glob: "**/*.js"
          headers:
            Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800, immutable
            Content-Type: application/javascript
            Content-Encoding: gzip
            Content-Language: fr-CA
            Content-Disposition: inline

        - glob: "**/*":
          headers:
            Cache-Control: public, no-cache
    required: false

runs:
  using: node16
  main: dist/index.js
